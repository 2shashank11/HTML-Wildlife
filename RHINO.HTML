	The Indian rhinoceros, also called the greater one-horned 
	rhinoceros and great Indian rhinoceros, is a rhinoceros 
	species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is listed as 
	Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as populations are 
	fragmented and restricted to less than 20,000 km<SUP>2</SUP>. 
	The Indian rhinoceros once ranged throughout the entire 
	stretch of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, but excessive hunting and 
	agricultural development reduced its range drastically to 11 
	sites in northern India and southern Nepal. In the early 
	1990s, between 1,870 and 1,895 rhinos were estimated to have 
	been alive.
