	<P>Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated 
	animal species, but has come to include all organisms that 
	grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by 
	humans. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, 
	forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, 
	including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct 
	forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually 
	refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most 
	scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human 
	activities.</P>
