	The Bengal tiger is a Panthera tigris tigris population native 
	to the Indian subcontinent. It is threatened by poaching, 
	loss, and fragmentation of habitat, and was estimated at 
	comprising fewer than 2,500 individuals by 2011. None of the 
	Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered 
	large enough to support an effective population of more than 
	250 adult individuals. India's tiger population was estimated 
	at 1,706–1,909 individuals in 2010. By 2018, the population 
	had increased to an estimated 2,603–3,346 individuals. Around
 	440 tigers are estimated in Bangladesh, 163–253 tigers in 
	Nepal and 103 tigers in Bhutan.
