	The Asiatic lion is a Panthera leo leo population in India. 
	Its range is restricted to the Gir National Park and 
	environs in the Indian state of Gujarat. On the IUCN Red 
	List, it is listed under its former scientific name Panthera 
	leo persica as Endangered because of its small population 
	size and area of occupancy. Since the turn of the 20th 
	century, it is restricted to the Gir Forest National Park 
	and surrounding areas. This lion population has steadily 
	increased since 2010. In May 2015, the 14th Asiatic Lion 
	Census was conducted over an area of about 20,000 km
	<SUP>2</SUP> the lion population was estimated at 523 
	individuals, comprising 109 adult males, 201 adult females 
	and 213 cubs. In August 2017, surveyors counted 650 wild 
	lions. The lion is one of five pantherine cats inhabiting 
	India, along with the Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, snow 
	leopard and clouded leopard. It was also known as 
	"Indian lion" and "Persian lion".
