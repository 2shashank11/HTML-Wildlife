	The Indian elephant is one of three extant recognised 
	subspecies of the Asian elephant and native to mainland Asia. 
	In general, Asian elephants are smaller than African 
	elephants and have the highest body point on the head. 
	The tip of their trunk has one finger-like process. 
	Their skin colour is lighter than of maximus with smaller 
	patches of depigmentation, but darker than of sumatranus. 
	Females are usually smaller than males, and have short or no 
	tusks.Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been listed as 
	Endangered on the IUCN Red List as the wild population has 
	declined by at least 50% since the 1930s to 1940s. 
	The Asian elephant is threatened by habitat loss, degradation 
	and fragmentation.
