	The sloth bear is a myrmecophagous bear species native to the 
	Indian subcontinent. It feeds on fruits, ants and termites. 
	It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, mainly 
	because of habitat loss and degradation. It has also been 
	called "labiated bear" because of its long lower lip and 
	palate used for sucking insects. It has a long, shaggy fur, 
	a mane around the face, and long, sickle-shaped claws. 
	It is lankier than brown and Asian black bears. It shares 
	features of insectivorous mammals and evolved during the 
	Pleistocene from the ancestral brown bear through convergent 
	evolution.
