	The Indian leopard is a leopard subspecies widely distributed 
	on the Indian subcontinent. The species Panthera pardus is 
	listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because populations 
	have declined following habitat loss and fragmentation, 
	poaching for the illegal trade of skins and body parts, and 
	persecution due to conflict situations. The Indian leopard is 
	one of the big cats occurring on the Indian subcontinent, 
	apart from the Asiatic lion, Bengal tiger, snow leopard and 
	clouded leopard. In 2014, a national census of leopards 
	around tiger habitats was carried out in India except the 
	northeast. 7,910 individuals were estimated in surveyed 
	areas and a national total of 12,000-14,000 speculated.
