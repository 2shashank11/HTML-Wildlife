	The lion-tailed macaque, also known as the bruh, is an Old 
	World monkey endemic to the Western Ghats of South India. 
	The hair of the lion-tailed macaque is black. Its outstanding 
	characteristic is the silver-white mane which surrounds the 
	head from the cheeks down to its chin, which gives this 
	monkey its German name Bartaffe - "beard ape". The hairless 
	face is black in colour. With a head-body length of 42 to 
	61 cm and a weight of 2 to 10 kg, it ranks among the smaller 
	macaques. The tail is medium in length at about 25 cm, and 
	has a black tuft at the end that is similar to a lion's tail, 
	although this tuft is more pronounced in males than in 
	females.
