	The wild water buffalo, also called Asian buffalo, Asiatic 
	buffalo and wild Asian buffalo, is a large bovine native to 
	the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It has been 
	listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List since 1986, as the 
	remaining population totals less than 4,000. A population 
	decline of at least 50% over the last three generations 
	(24–30 years) is projected to continue. The global population 
	has been estimated at 3,400 individuals, of which 3,100 
	(91%) live in India, mostly in Assam. The wild water buffalo 
	is the probable ancestor of the domestic water buffalo.
